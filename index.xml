Connecting a virtual machine to the router Firstly, a new Proxmox virtual machine must be created. Ensure its network device is set to vmbr2 (which is configured as the OPT1 device in pfSense).
Setting up virtual IP addresses Virtual IPs are required for NAT.</description></item><item><title>Remote Lab, Part 3: Installing pfSense</title><link>https://netsplit.uk/posts/2019/02/17/installing_pfsense/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2019 22:22:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://netsplit.uk/posts/2019/02/17/installing_pfsense/</guid><description>Part 1 (Introduction, OVH configuration.)

First boot At the firewall&amp;rsquo;s first boot, we need to set up the bare minimum for accessing the web interface, where the configuration will be finalised.
VLANs do not need setting up at this time.
Assign vtnet0 (or em0) as the WAN interface. Set the IP address to your first failover IP address (ex.</description></item><item><title>Remote Lab, Part 2: Configuring Proxmox</title><link>https://netsplit.uk/posts/2019/02/13/configuring_proxmox/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2019 22:02:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://netsplit.uk/posts/2019/02/13/configuring_proxmox/</guid><description>Part 1 (Introduction, OVH configuration.) Part 2 (Configuring Proxmox. You&amp;rsquo;re here!) Part 3 (Installing pfSense.) Part 4 (Configuring pfSense.) Now, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to install Proxmox on the server. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover the basic installation in this post, but I am using Proxmox VE 5, which is available as a template during installation with OVH&amp;rsquo;s wizard.
Securing Proxmox&amp;rsquo;s web interface Once you have installed your hypervisor and logged in, I recommend taking a couple of extra steps to improve security, because the web interface is public facing:</description></item><item><title>Remote Lab, Part 1: Pre-Installation Configuration</title><link>https://netsplit.uk/posts/2019/02/13/remote_proxmox_lab_intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2019 20:05:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://netsplit.uk/posts/2019/02/13/remote_proxmox_lab_intro/</guid><description>Part 1 (Introduction, OVH configuration. You&amp;rsquo;re here!) Part 2 (Configuring Proxmox.) Part 3 (Installing pfSense.) Part 4 (Configuring pfSense.) Overview This guide details how to set up a remote lab with a pfSense gateway on an OVH dedicated server, including basic firewall rules for managing access to the router&amp;rsquo;s web interface, and use of Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt for SSL certificates.
First, we&amp;rsquo;ll configure the server and its IP addresses.</description></item><item><title>Building a Mattermost Chatbot in Perl</title><link>https://netsplit.uk/posts/2019/01/09/mattermost-bot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 17:53:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://netsplit.uk/posts/2019/01/09/mattermost-bot/</guid><description>Introduction WebService::Mattermost is an alternative Mattermost chatbot library written in Perl. It provides two interfaces to the Mattermost API and WebSocket gateway: from a script, and as a base for Moo and Moose classes. In this article, I will cover how to use it in a basic script, and demonstrate with a bot which greets users.
Requirements Installable from CPAN:
