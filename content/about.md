## Technology

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), HTML5 and is JavaScript-free. [Its source can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/n7st/netsplit.uk).
Its design is kept simple on purpose in an attempt to follow principles set out by ["Better Motherfucking Website"](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/),
and earlier ["Motherfucking Website"](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com).

Currently, the website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
